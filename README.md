# my-second-website
^this is my second website which is written is HTML, CSS and little bit of Javascript.

^Its name is Personal Times.

^A new thing which I have implemented in this site is a Javascript animation via which 
when we scroll the window towards the bottom the header nav bar will be dragged along 
with the window after it has reached the top of the screen.
